# [JSL10] Submission: Escaping Vanilla JS: Abstraction Challenge

You will:
1. Use the provided Starter Code Repository: https://github.com/CodeSpace-Academy/Module_10_StudentNo_Classcode_Group_Name-Surname_JSL10
2. Code your solution.
3. Commit changes to your GitHub repository.
4. Submit the GitHub Repository Link to the LMS [JSL10] Submission Project Tab.

The Escape Vanilla JS Challenge is an interactive web-based project focusing on debugging skills, problem-solving, and the concept of abstraction. You will navigate through three themed "rooms," each presenting a unique challenge that requires them to debug and correct given JavaScript code to proceed. This adventure is themed around escaping the confines of Vanilla JavaScript to advance towards learning React.

#### Debugging Tasks

1. **Corrected the ID used in the event listener for Room 1.**
2. **Changed the element ID to room1.**
3. **Add the missing 'async' keyword to the JS concepts set.**
4. **Correct the function call to find the intersection of `jsConcepts` and `reactConcepts` for Room 2.**
5. **Ensure asynchronous operations are handled correctly in Room 3, particularly by adding `await` before the promise in `navigateLabyrinth`.**
6. **Adjust the `findMostRecentBook` function to correctly compare dates and find the most recent book.**
7. **Fix the `findIntersection` function to correctly determine the intersection of two sets.**
8. **Add the `await` keyword before `new Promise` in `navigateLabyrinth` to ensure the simulation of asynchronous operations works as intended.**
